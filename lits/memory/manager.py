@dataclass
class AugmentedContext:
    """
    Aggregated memory bundle returned by :class:`LiTSMemoryManager`.

    This class bundles all memory information needed for a node expansion in LiTS-Mem.
    It is returned by :meth:`LiTSMemoryManager.build_augmented_context` and contains
    both inherited memories (from ancestor nodes) and cross-trajectory memories
    (from similar trajectories in the search tree).

    The bundle is intentionally lightweight so callers across :mod:`lits.agents`,
    :mod:`lits.components`, and :mod:`lits.framework_config` can pass it around without
    worrying about backend details. Policies typically call :meth:`to_prompt_blocks`
    when constructing LLM prompts for node expansion.

    Attributes:
        trajectory: The :class:`TrajectoryKey` identifying the current node's position
            in the search tree. Format: ``TrajectoryKey(search_id, indices=(0, 1))``
            represents the path root → child[0] → child[1].
        inherited_units: Memory facts from ancestor nodes in the current trajectory.
            These are memories that "flow down" from parent to child - if a fact was
            recorded at node ``q/0``, it is inherited by all descendants like ``q/0/1``,
            ``q/0/2``, etc. Sorted by depth and creation time.
        retrieved_trajectories: Results from cross-trajectory search. Each
            :class:`TrajectorySimilarity` contains:
            - ``trajectory_path``: Path of the similar trajectory (e.g., ``"q/1/0"``)
            - ``score``: Similarity score based on memory overlap
            - ``missing_units``: Facts present in the similar trajectory but absent
              from the current trajectory - these are the "new insights" to augment
            - ``overlapping_units``: Facts that both trajectories share (for provenance)

    Example:
        During MCTS expansion at node ``q/0/1``::

            context = memory_manager.build_augmented_context(node.trajectory_key)
            
            # inherited_units might contain:
            # - "The problem requires finding the derivative" (from q)
            # - "Using chain rule for composition" (from q/0)
            
            # retrieved_trajectories might find q/1 as similar, with missing_units:
            # - "Consider substitution u = x^2" (insight from sibling trajectory)
            
            prompt_addition = context.to_prompt_blocks()
            # Inject into policy prompt for better action generation

        Format the augmented context as a single string suitable for concatenation with
        policy prompts.

        This method renders all memory information into a human-readable format that can
        be injected into LLM prompts. The output includes:
        
        1. **Known facts** (if ``include_inherited=True``): Facts already established
           in the current reasoning chain, formatted as a bulleted list under
           "# Known facts from your current reasoning"
        2. **Insights from other attempts**: For each similar trajectory found,
           includes facts that the current reasoning chain hasn't discovered yet

            include_inherited: Whether to include inherited memories in the output.
                Set to ``False`` if inherited context is already in the prompt.

        Returns:
            A formatted string ready for prompt injection. Returns empty string if
            no memories are available.

        Example output::

            # Known facts from your current reasoning
            - The problem requires finding the derivative
            - Using chain rule for composition

            # Insights from a previous attempt (relevance: 0.75)

    * ``record_action`` is called whenever the policy emits an action/response.

    * ``list_inherited_units`` (or ``build_augmented_context``) runs at the start of
      node expansion to recover cross-trajectory context.
    * ``search_related_trajectories`` can be invoked by evaluators (e.g., PRM/BN
